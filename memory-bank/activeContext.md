- **Content Formatting**: Specialized formatting for different data types (dates, moods, categories)
- **Tailwind v4 Compatibility**: Use direct CSS variables instead of @theme for reliability
- **Server/Client Component Separation**: Keep interactive elements in separate Client Components
- Maintain business card aesthetic consistency
- Professional legal industry standards
- Bilingual content support (Vietnamese + Chinese characters)
- Clean, elegant component composition

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Modal UX Best Practices**: 
  - Backdrop blur creates focus without losing context
  - ESC key and outside-click are essential for user control
  - Scroll lock prevents background scrolling confusion
  - Responsive sizing ensures content fits well on all devices

- **React Context for Modals**: 
  - Context prevents complex prop drilling through component tree
  - Central modal manager simplifies routing to correct modal type
  - Custom hooks provide clean API for modal operations

- **TypeScript with Modals**:
  - Proper typing ensures modal data matches expected structure
  - Union types for modal types provide type safety
  - Generic interfaces allow reusable components

- **Vietnamese Localization**:
  - Date formatting with Vietnamese locale creates familiar UX
  - Mood names in Vietnamese enhance personal connection
  - Consistent language throughout modal content

- **Tailwind v4 Critical Learning**: Beta version requires different configuration approach
  - @theme and complex config patterns may not work reliably
  - Direct CSS variables with !important provide better control
  - CSS custom properties more reliable than Tailwind's theme system in v4 beta

- **Next.js 13+ App Router Critical Pattern**: Server Components cannot have event handlers
  - Always use "use client" directive for components with onClick, onChange, etc.
  - Extract interactive elements to separate Client Components when possible
  - Maintain performance benefits of Server Components for static content

- Legal professional portfolios require:
  - Strong emphasis on credentials and company affiliation
  - Conservative, elegant design approach
  - Clear contact information prominence
  - Professional tone throughout

- Chinese character support is essential for name display (ÈòÆ Èùû ÁéÑ)
- Company branding integration is crucial for credibility

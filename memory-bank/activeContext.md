## Active Decisions
- **Architecture**: Server Components for static content, Client Components only for interactivity
- **Styling Approach**: Direct CSS with variables for Tailwind v4 compatibility
- **Color Palette**: Navy blue background (#1e2a4a) with gold text (#f5cda1) matching business card
- **Typography**: Playfair Display serif for elegance, Noto Serif TC for Chinese characters
- **Layout**: Single-page design with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements

## Important Patterns
- **Tailwind v4 Compatibility**: Use direct CSS variables instead of @theme for reliability
- **Server/Client Component Separation**: Keep interactive elements in separate Client Components
- Maintain business card aesthetic consistency
- Professional legal industry standards
- Bilingual content support (Vietnamese + Chinese characters)
- Clean, elegant component composition

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Tailwind v4 Critical Learning**: Beta version requires different configuration approach
  - @theme and complex config patterns may not work reliably
  - Direct CSS variables with !important provide better control
  - CSS custom properties more reliable than Tailwind's theme system in v4 beta

- **Next.js 13+ App Router Critical Pattern**: Server Components cannot have event handlers
  - Always use "use client" directive for components with onClick, onChange, etc.
  - Extract interactive elements to separate Client Components when possible
  - Maintain performance benefits of Server Components for static content

- Legal professional portfolios require:
  - Strong emphasis on credentials and company affiliation
  - Conservative, elegant design approach
  - Clear contact information prominence
  - Professional tone throughout

- Chinese character support is essential for name display (阮 非 玄)
- Company branding integration is crucial for credibility

# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Portfolio website has been completely redesigned with full-screen sections and smooth scrolling as requested in Vietnamese. The layout now features immersive full-viewport sections that gradually reveal content as users scroll.

## Recent Changes
- **MAJOR REDESIGN: Full-Screen Layout Implementation**
  - **Hero Section**: Now occupies full viewport height (`h-screen`) with enhanced portrait display
  - **Company Section**: Full-screen company information with improved card design
  - **Qualifications Section**: Full-screen timeline with enhanced visual hierarchy
  - **Blog Section**: Full-screen blog cards with hover animations
  - **Interests Section**: Min-height screen with optimized spacing

- **NEW: Smooth Scrolling Navigation System**
  - Created `Navigation.tsx` component with floating dots navigation
  - Implemented active section tracking with scroll position detection
  - Added smooth scroll behavior with CSS and JavaScript
  - Desktop-only navigation (hidden on mobile for clean UX)

- **ENHANCED: Visual Effects and Animations**
  - Added scroll indicator with "Kéo xuống" text and bounce animation
  - Implemented background decorative elements with opacity
  - Enhanced hover effects with scale transforms and glow effects
  - Added custom scrollbar styling with navy/gold theme
  - New CSS animations: float, pulse-glow, enhanced transitions

- **IMPROVED: Typography and Spacing**
  - Increased heading sizes to 5xl-6xl for better impact
  - Enhanced spacing between sections and elements
  - Improved responsive typography scaling
  - Better visual hierarchy with larger text sizes

## Next Steps
1. **Content Enhancement** (Optional)
   - Replace placeholder portrait image with actual professional photo
   - Add real company logo for Oriental International Law Firm
   - Fine-tune any specific content details
   - Add actual IELTS score if desired

2. **Performance Optimization** (Optional)
   - Add proper meta tags for SEO
   - Optimize image loading and implement lazy loading
   - Add favicon and app icons
   - Implement intersection observer for better scroll performance

3. **Feature Enhancements** (Optional)
   - Add contact form functionality
   - Consider blog functionality for dynamic content
   - Implement parallax scrolling effects
   - Add loading animations between sections

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture**: Server Components for static content, Client Components only for interactivity
- **Styling Approach**: Direct CSS with variables for Tailwind v4 compatibility
- **Color Palette**: Navy blue background (#1e2a4a) with gold text (#f5cda1) matching business card
- **Typography**: Playfair Display serif for elegance, Noto Serif TC for Chinese characters
- **Layout**: Full-screen sections with smooth scrolling navigation and floating dots
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **User Experience**: Immersive full-viewport sections that gradually reveal content
- **Navigation**: Floating dots navigation for desktop, hidden on mobile for clean UX

## Important Patterns
- **Tailwind v4 Compatibility**: Use direct CSS variables instead of @theme for reliability
- **Server/Client Component Separation**: Keep interactive elements in separate Client Components
- Maintain business card aesthetic consistency
- Professional legal industry standards
- Bilingual content support (Vietnamese + Chinese characters)
- Clean, elegant component composition

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Tailwind v4 Critical Learning**: Beta version requires different configuration approach
  - @theme and complex config patterns may not work reliably
  - Direct CSS variables with !important provide better control
  - CSS custom properties more reliable than Tailwind's theme system in v4 beta

- **Next.js 13+ App Router Critical Pattern**: Server Components cannot have event handlers
  - Always use "use client" directive for components with onClick, onChange, etc.
  - Extract interactive elements to separate Client Components when possible
  - Maintain performance benefits of Server Components for static content

- Legal professional portfolios require:
  - Strong emphasis on credentials and company affiliation
  - Conservative, elegant design approach
  - Clear contact information prominence
  - Professional tone throughout

- Chinese character support is essential for name display (阮 非 玄)
- Company branding integration is crucial for credibility
